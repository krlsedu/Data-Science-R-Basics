# Here is how you compute the sum for the first 20 integers
20*(20+1)/2

# However, we can define a variable to use the formula for other values of n
n <- 20
n*(n+1)/2

n <- 25
n*(n+1)/2

# Below, write code to calculate the sum of the first 100 integers
n <- 1000
n*(n+1)/2

n <- 1000
x <- seq(1,n)
sum(x)


log10(sqrt(100))

x <- 2
log(10^x)

log10(x^10)

log(exp(x))

exp(log(x, base = 2))
